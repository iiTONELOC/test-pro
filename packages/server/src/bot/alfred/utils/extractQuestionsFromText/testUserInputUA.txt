Hide question 6 feedback
Correct!!  This is NOT a real OS type!

There are four general types of operating systems. Their use depends on the type of computer and the type of applications that will be run on those computers.

Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are used to control machinery, scientific instruments, and industrial systems. In general, the user does not have much control over the functions performed by the RTOS.
Single-user, single task operating systems allow one user to do one thing at a time. And example of a single-user, single task operating system is the operating system used by personal digital assistants (PDAs), also known as handheld computers.
Single-user, multi-tasking operating systems allow a single user to simultaneously run multiple applications on their computer. This is the type of operating system found on most personal desktop and laptop computers. The Windows (Microsoft) and Macintosh (Apple) platforms are the most popular single-user, multi-tasking operating systems.
Multi-user operating systems allow multiple users to simultaneously use the resources on a single computer. Unix is an example of a multi-user operating system.
