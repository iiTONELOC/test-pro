## Description

Test Pro is a studying tool designed to help you study for exams and retain information.

### Motivation

I am a FullStack Web Developer and CyberOps Engineering Student currently preparing for CompTIA Exams, particularly Security+, Network+, and hopefully the CySA+. I hope to take the exams in the coming months. While I can read my study materials thoroughly, I recognize the need for a more effective way to review and consolidate the information. The goal is to develop a digital tool akin to flashcards, organized for comprehensive review and progress tracking.

### User Story

`As a learner, I want to create quiz questions to reinforce my understanding of various topics and prepare for my exams. The ability to revisit and retake these quizzes is important to me. Additionally, I would like to review questions associated with a specific topic. Post-quiz, I aim to review both correct and incorrect answers, assess my score, and evaluate the time I spent on the quiz. Although accessing this tool across multiple devices is desirable, it's currently not a priority, as I can effectively study using a single computer for now.`

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
